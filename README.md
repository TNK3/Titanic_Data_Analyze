# Titanic_Data_Analyze

Project Title:- Exploratory Analysis and Visualization of Titanic Dataset

Objective:-
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger demographics, survival rates, and factors affecting survival probability. Present findings through visualizations.

Dataset:-
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Passenger age.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Fare: Ticket fare.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Workflow:-
Step 1: Data Loading
Import the Titanic dataset using Python:

Step 2: Data Cleaning
1)Handle Missing Values:

2)Convert Categorical Data:
Convert sex and embarked columns into numeric codes.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1)Survival Rate Overview:

Calculate the overall survival rate:
Columns like age, embarked, and deck may have missing data.

2)Survival by Class:

Compare survival rates across passenger classes:

3)Survival by Gender:

Analyze survival rates for males and females:

4)Fare Distribution:

Understand ticket fare distribution:

Step 4: Data Visualization
1)Survival Rate by Gender and Class:

2)Age Distribution of Survivors:

3)Correlation Heatmap:
